### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Decision-making is the process of determing the order in which statements execute in a program. If statements are the most common and they are used to execute a specific programming code. 
2. Switch statements control program flow by executing a specific set of statements. They compare expressions value to value contained within a case label.
3. To execute a named function, one must call it. This is done by code calling a function, which is the function name followed by parentheses, i.e. myfunction().
